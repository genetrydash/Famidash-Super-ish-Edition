# Famidash-Super-ish-Edition
Geometry dash for the SNES (kind of)
# Description
This is basically [FamiDash](https://github.com/tfdsoft/famidash) (beta 5) for the NES just emulated on an SNES using the [Nested Emulator](https://github.com/Myself086/Project-Nested).

So, I basically did nothing.

This is your best bet until kando (the lead famidash dev) decides to make the real super famidash which is specifically designed for SNES and uses all of its capabilities.

Thank me later for saving you 20 mins for your life having to upload the ROM to the emulator exe converter.
