# Famidash-Super-ish-Edition
Geometry dash for the SNES (kind of)
# Description
This is basically famidash for the NES just emulated on an SNES using the nested emulator
So I basically did nothing
This is your best bet until kando (the lead famidash dev) decides to make the real super famidash which is specifically designed for SNES and uses all of its capabilities
Thank me later for saving you 20 mins for your life having to uploaf the ROM to the emulator
